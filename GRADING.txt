Requirements Met:
	Begin Map Displayed [4pts]
	Final Values F(x), H(x), G(x) [6pts]
	Final Path Drawn [4pts]
	Final Length/# of Steps Displayed [4pts]*
	Efficiency: Animates Smoothly [4pts]
	Animation Speed Configurability [4pts]**
	Supports environment grid size of 204 tiles (17x12***) [4pts]
	Support different configured environments [4pts]
	Goal (X,Y) configurability [2pts]
	Start (X,Y) configurability [2pts]
	Stepped [4pts]
	Report with Screenshots [6pts]
	Grading.txt [4pts]
	README [2pts]
	Demo [10pts] (in class)

For my embellishments, I decided to...
	compare three different heuristics [15pts] (Diagonal, Euclidean, Euclidean Squared),
	compare Dijkstra's [5pts], 
	compare Best First [5pts]
	
	The combinations of algorithms and heuristics are:
		1) A* + Manhattan (H only uses up/down/left/right paths, openList sorted by F score)
		2) A* + Diagonal  (H uses all directions and adjusts length for diagonals, openList sorted by F score)
		3) A* + Euclidean (H uses line distance (sqrt(dx*dx+dy*dy)), openList sorted by F score)
		4) A* + Euclidean Squared (Euclidean without sqrt, openList sorted by F score)
		5) Dijkstra + 0 (H=0, openList sorted by F score)
		6) Best First + Manhattan (H only uses up/down/left/right paths, openList sorted by H score)

		
*Final Length/# of Steps Displayed [4pts]
  Final Length/# of steps are shown in the Start Node once path has been found.
			N = (#C,#P)
		where N = "number of nodes",
			 #C = number of nodes processed by algorithm in order to find path.
			 #P = number of nodes in path from start to goal (does NOT include start in total)
			 
**Animation Speed configurability [4pts]
   Cannot step through any faster in terms of step by step 
		(will always show the results of processing the next/previous node for every arrow press)
    However, the final results can by displayed without stepping through each step by pressing enter
		And can stop stepping through at any time by pressing enter.
		
***Supports environment grid size of at least 200 tiles [4pts]
   >>Updated after demo to support 17x12 grid size (total tiles = 204)<<
   >>Cannot be changed at run time<<
	Grid size is 150 tiles (15x10) but it could be updated to support a larger size.
	To do this, I would need to change the size of the background layer to support more tiles
	and update a few constants to account for it (to make sure all tiles got covered).
