BALL, Catherine 

To Run:
	I have included the source files in my nike submission (in order to view the source code).
	I also uploaded a baked version to a public repo
		repo link: https://github.com/Faruhcon/Project3b
		demo link: 
	To run the uploaded version, just follow the demo link.
	To run the uploaded version from the repo, clone the repo and run /index.html 
	To run the source file version, you will need to copy the contents within the impact directory
		and run impact/index.html
		**To run locally, I used xampp.
